# Reference Implementations

We're currently in the process of implementing reference implementations of this specification in
Python. To learn more, visit our repositories for:

- [`pycoalaip`](https://github.com/bigchaindb/pycoalaip) - A Python library for creating COALA IP
  models in JSON-LD and IPLD
    - [`pycoalaip-bigchaindb`](https://github.com/bigchaindb/pycoalaip-bigchaindb) - A plugin for
      `pycoalaip` to persist COALA IP models on BigchainDB
- [`coalaip-http-api`](https://github.com/bigchaindb/coalaip-http-api) - A HTTP REST API wrapper
  around `pycoalaip`

We'd love to see other other implementations! See [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to help.
